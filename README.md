🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, etc.

The model is built using Logistic Regression and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
